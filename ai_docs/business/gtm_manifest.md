## 1. ICP - Ideal Customer Profile

We focus on **HR Recruitment professionals and Talent Acquisition specialists** who work in:

**Mid-to-Large Corporate HR Teams** (5-15 HR professionals) at companies with:

- 500-2000 employees with continuous hiring needs
- 50+ open positions per quarter across multiple departments
- Dedicated talent acquisition teams with specialized recruiters
- Annual recruitment budget of $200K-1M+
- Average cost-per-hire of $5,000-12,000

**Large Recruitment Agencies** (10-50 recruiters) that:

- Process 500+ candidate applications per month per recruiter
- Handle multiple client accounts with diverse role requirements
- Operate on volume-based business models (contingency fees 20-30%)
- Have dedicated technical recruiting teams
- Struggle with standardizing interview quality across recruiters

Both segments share critical challenges: **inconsistent interview quality**, **interviewer fatigue from conducting 20+ interviews per week**, and **subjective bias** affecting hiring decisions in competitive talent markets.

## 2. Current Workflow / Jobs to be Done and Pain Points

These HR teams currently spend **50+ hours per week** on interview-related activities:

- **Post-interview evaluation**: 20 minutes writing detailed assessment reports
- **Interview coordination**: 15 minutes average per scheduling interaction
