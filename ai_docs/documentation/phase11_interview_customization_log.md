# Phase 11: Interview Customization & Question Bank System

## Session Date: September 2, 2025

## Overview
This session focused on giving HR complete control over AI interview customization through question distribution settings and a comprehensive question bank management system. The implementation allows HR to define how AI conducts interviews and manage a library of role-specific questions.

## Major Features Implemented

### 1. AI Interview Question Distribution Settings
**Location**: Step 5 in HR Dashboard Pipeline (`/src/app/(hr)/dashboard/page.tsx`)

#### Features Added:
- **Percentage-based Question Type Distribution**:
  - Technical Questions (default 50%)
  - Behavioral Questions (default 30%)
  - Experience Questions (default 20%)
  
- **Smart Distribution Logic**:
  - Real-time sliders with 5% increments
  - Automatic adjustment of other values when one changes
  - Total must equal 100% validation
  - Visual feedback with color-coded totals
  
- **Visual Distribution Bar**:
  - Horizontal stacked bar chart
  - Color-coded segments (Blue/Green/Purple)
  - Percentage labels within segments
  - Legend for clarity

#### Implementation Details:
```tsx
const [questionDistribution, setQuestionDistribution] = useState({
  technical: 50,
  behavioral: 30,
  experience: 20
})

const handleQuestionDistributionChange = (type, value) => {
  // Smart adjustment logic to maintain 100% total
  // Proportionally reduces other values if total would exceed 100%
}
```

### 2. Comprehensive Question Bank System
**Location**: `/src/app/(hr)/dashboard/question-bank/page.tsx`

#### Core Features:

##### Role Management:
- Create roles with specific attributes:
  - Role Name (e.g., Java Developer, React Developer)
  - Experience Level (Junior, Middle, Senior, Lead, Principal)
  - Department (Backend, Frontend, DevOps, QA, Data Science, Mobile, Full Stack)
- Delete roles with confirmation dialog
- Question count indicators per role

##### Question Management:
- **Question Properties**:
  - Question text (required)
  - Type (Technical/Behavioral/Experience)
  - Difficulty (Easy/Medium/Hard)
  - Expected Answer (optional)
  - Time Limit (1-30 minutes)
  - Tags for categorization
  
- **CRUD Operations**:
  - Create new questions
  - Edit existing questions
  - Duplicate questions for reuse
  - Delete with confirmation
  
- **Search & Filtering**:
  - Real-time search by question text or tags
  - Filter by question type
  - Filter by difficulty level
  - Combined filtering support

##### Visual Design:
- Color-coded badges:
  - Type: Blue (Technical), Green (Behavioral), Purple (Experience)
  - Difficulty: Green (Easy), Yellow (Medium), Red (Hard)
- Icons for visual clarity (Code, Users, Briefcase)
- Scrollable lists for many items
- Card-based layout for questions

### 3. Question Selection Integration in Pipeline
**Location**: Step 5 of HR Dashboard (`interview-config` step)

#### Three Selection Modes:

##### 1. Automatic Mode (Default):
- AI generates questions based on job requirements
- Follows set distribution percentages
- No manual intervention needed

##### 2. From Question Bank:
- Select specific questions from the question bank
- Opens question bank in new tab
- Shows count of selected questions
- AI uses these during interviews

##### 3. Custom Questions:
- Write questions directly in the pipeline
- One question per line format
- Real-time question count
- Clear all functionality
- Interview-specific questions

#### Additional Features:
- Skip/Reset option to use AI defaults
- Reset to Default button for quick clearing
- Tab-based interface for mode selection

### 4. Navigation Updates

#### Added Question Bank to all navigation components:
- **Sidebar** (`sidebar.tsx`): Added with BookOpen icon
- **Dashboard Nav** (`dashboard-nav.tsx`): Added to collapsible nav
- **Main Navigation** (`navigation.tsx`): Added to top nav
- **Constants** (`constants.ts`): Added `HR_QUESTION_BANK` route

#### Route Configuration:
```tsx
HR_QUESTION_BANK: "/dashboard/question-bank"
```

### 5. UI/UX Improvements

#### Font Size Optimization (User Request):
Reduced font sizes throughout for a more compact, professional appearance:

- **Dialog Titles**: `text-base font-semibold`
- **Dialog Descriptions**: `text-xs`
- **Labels**: `text-xs font-medium`
- **Input Fields**: `text-sm` with `h-8` height
- **Buttons**: `size="sm"` with `text-sm`
- **Question Text**: `text-sm`
- **Expected Answers**: `text-xs`

#### Layout Improvements:
- Fixed border issues in dialogs
- Consistent spacing with `space-y-1.5`
- Proper scrolling for long content
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Clean visual hierarchy

## Technical Implementation Details

### State Management Patterns

#### Question Distribution:
```tsx
// Smart distribution that maintains 100% total
const handleQuestionDistributionChange = (type, value) => {
  const otherTypes = Object.keys(questionDistribution).filter(k => k !== type)
  const currentOthersTotal = otherTypes.reduce((sum, t) => sum + questionDistribution[t], 0)
  const newTotal = value + currentOthersTotal
  
  if (newTotal <= 100) {
    // Simple update
  } else {
    // Proportional adjustment of other values
  }
}
```

#### Question Bank State:
```tsx
interface Question {
  id: string
  question: string
  type: QuestionType
  difficulty: QuestionDifficulty
  expectedAnswer?: string
  timeLimit?: number
  tags: string[]
  createdAt: Date
  updatedAt: Date
}

interface Role {
  id: string
  name: string
  level: string
  department: string
  questions: Question[]
  createdAt: Date
}
```

### Pipeline Integration:
```tsx
// New step added to pipeline
type PipelineStep = "vacancy" | "upload" | "analysis" | 
                   "notification" | "interview-config" | 
                   "scheduling" | "complete"

// Question selection state
const [questionSelectionMode, setQuestionSelectionMode] = useState<"auto" | "manual" | "custom">("auto")
const [selectedQuestions, setSelectedQuestions] = useState<any[]>([])
const [customQuestions, setCustomQuestions] = useState<string>("")
```

## User Experience Enhancements

### For HR Managers:
1. **Complete Control**: Set exact percentages for question types
2. **Flexibility**: Three modes of question selection
3. **Efficiency**: Reusable question library
4. **Organization**: Role-based question management
5. **Customization**: Per-interview custom questions

### Visual Feedback:
- Real-time percentage updates
- Color-coded validation (red/green)
- Visual distribution bar chart
- Progress indicators
- Clear error messages

## Example Use Cases

### Scenario 1: Technical Role Interview
- Set distribution: 70% Technical, 20% Behavioral, 10% Experience
- Select specific technical questions from bank
- AI focuses on technical assessment

### Scenario 2: Leadership Position
- Set distribution: 30% Technical, 50% Behavioral, 20% Experience
- Add custom leadership-specific questions
- AI emphasizes soft skills and management

### Scenario 3: Quick Standard Interview
- Use default 50/30/20 distribution
- Select "Automatic" mode
- Let AI handle everything

## Bug Fixes and Improvements

1. **Navigation 404 Fix**: Corrected route from `/interview-reports` to `/dashboard/interview-reports`
2. **File Movement**: Moved interview-reports page to correct dashboard subdirectory
3. **Icon Consistency**: Changed from Brain to FileText icon for Reports as requested
4. **Label Updates**: Changed "AI Reports" to just "Reports" per user preference
5. **Font Size Reduction**: Made UI more compact and professional per user feedback

## Performance Considerations

- Lazy loading for question lists
- Efficient state updates with React hooks
- Optimized re-renders with proper dependencies
- Scrollable areas for long lists
- Client-side filtering for instant results

## Next Steps

1. **Backend Integration**:
   - API endpoints for question CRUD operations
   - Database schema for roles and questions
   - Question selection persistence
   
2. **Advanced Features**:
   - Question versioning
   - Question effectiveness analytics
   - Import/export question sets
   - Shared question libraries across teams
   
3. **AI Enhancement**:
   - Question difficulty auto-adjustment
   - Dynamic follow-up questions
   - Answer evaluation criteria
   
4. **Reporting**:
   - Question performance metrics
   - Candidate response analytics
   - Distribution effectiveness analysis
